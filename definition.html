A language of programming is a formal language which includes A collection of guidelines producing Different output styles. In computer programming the programming languages are used to apply algorithms. Most programming languages consist of the instructions on the computer. There are programmable machines that use a series of unique instructions instead of programming languages generally. The early ones preceded the invention of the digital machine, the first being possibly the automatic flute player mentioned in Bagdad by the Musa brothers, The machine behaviors such as Jacquard looms, boxes,music, and player pianos were controlled using the programs. The programs for these devices (such as scrolls from a player piano) did not generate different actions in response to various inputs or conditions. Thousands of different programming languages were created, and more are created annually. Many programming languages are written in an imperative style (I.e., as a set of operations to carry out) Whereas other languages use the declarative form (i.e. you select the desired result). not how to achieve it). The programming language definition is generally divided into two components of the syntax (form) and the semantic (meaning). A specification document describes such languages (for example, an ISO standard specifies the programming language for C) Whereas other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation which is considered the language of reference. Some languages have the two, Popular with the basic language specified by the Standard and extensions derived from the dominant implementation.
