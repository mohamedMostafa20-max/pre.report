<h1>C++ language</h1>
C++ language has an object-oriented structure that is used in broad projects. 
Programmers will work with one program in various sections on each aspect of the programme,
Or even at a single job. The object oriented framework also enables multiple reuse of code. 
This language is an effective language. But, many programmers disagree with that
<h2>C language</h2> 
Easy programming language, the C language is a very popular language,
Especially used when programming games, since C needs additional packaging in C++,
Every programmer uses this language because it speeds up the programs. However, 
 the importance of this language gives C++ the reusability to get the small performance improvement with C language.
<h3>Pascal language</h3>
Pascal language is mainly a teaching language and this language is used by few industries to compose the programmes.
 In C language this language tends to use keywords rather than symbols and braces.
 So beginners understand this language Quite simple to use than the programming language like C , C++. Borland is a Software Engineer
Company which uses the Delphi programming language for strength in the industry. Delphi is an object-oriented Pascal language, which is currently used only by Borland compilers.
<h4>Java language</h4>
Java language is a multi-plateform language which is especially useful in networking. Of course, 
with Java applets mostly this language is used on the web. However, this language is used in structuring and syntaxing cross-platform programs;
As this is equivalent to C++. Java language is very simple to learn for C++ programmers, and it provides some of the advantages of object-oriented programming.
 Including reusability and the writing of effective code in Java can be difficult. But the speed of the Java language has increased nowadays, 
 and version 1.5 offers some nice features for fast programmaking.
<h5>PHP language</h5>
PHP language is used for website building, and is also often used as a scripting language.
This language is designed to produce a quick website, and therefore includes features that make it easy to generate HTTP headers and link to databases. 
 It Includes a collection of components as scripting language that makes it easy for the programmer to get up to speed. However, It has features which are more advanced object oriented.
